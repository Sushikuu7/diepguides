        <p>Bullets Per Cycle: 1-25</p>
        <p>Main Bullet Strength: 600% BTE</p>
        <p>Bullet Speed: 50% BTE</p>
        <p>Shrapnel Speed: 75% BTE</p>
        <p>Recoil Per Cycle: 1500% BTE</p>
        <p>Reload Per Cycle: 25% BTE</p>
        <p>Shrapnel damage varies, more on that later.</p>
        <p><strong>Upgrade path</strong></p>
        <p>Basic → Machine Gun → Destroyer → Detonator</p>

        <h2 id="2-tank-details">2. Tank Details</h2>
        <p>The Detonator is a destroyer class with a special ability. The bullet shares all stats with destroyer as mentioned earlier except for one characteristic: When the main bullet takes damage, it will spit smaller bullets off of it totaling 50% of the damage taken to itself while the main bullet shrinks in size depending on how much damage it took.</p>
        <p>The shrapnel function operates like this:</p>
        <p>The base bullet does 600% BTE, which is equal to a Destroyer's. Let's say the bullet took an impact where 150% of it's health was diminished i.e. from killing a player. A bunch of pieces of shrapnel will be ejected totaling 75% of the damage taken to the main bullet, or just under one basic tank bullet. A detonator bullet can produce a maximum of 24 pieces of shrapnel before it dies so this impact would result in 6 pieces of shrapnel being released, doing 12.5% basic tank damage each, whereas the bullet would shrink in size by 25%. The shrapnel damage might get buffed if 12.5% basic damage ends up being insufficient.</p>
        <p>Depending on impact shrapnel can behave in multiple ways; a direct center impact produces an evenly spread could of shrapnel around the bullet as it flies away from the impact point; a slightly off center hit results in the shrapnel being ejected more to that side.</p>

        <p>Standard Balanced Glass Builds. Good for anything except taking a few hits.</p>
