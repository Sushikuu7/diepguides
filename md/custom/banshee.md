## 2. Tank Details

The Banshee is a combination of Auto 3 and Overseer, and when upgrading, it loses the ability to control the auto turrets. The auto turrets are the same power as normal Auto 3 turrets. To keep the drone count proportional to the amount of spawners and to keep it balanced, it spawns 6 drones total. They have the same amount of strength and speed as Overlord drones, and act the same way. Unlike the Auto 3, it does not spin automatically. Your tank will face in the direction that you point your cursor in. The front of the tank is the auto cannon and not the drone spawner. Unlike the Auto 3 and Auto 5, the maximum number of degrees that the auto cannons can target in is reduced from 140° to 100°, while keeping the same targeting range of about 27 BgS.

## 3. Builds

This build is fast, deadly, and has enough reload to make the auto cannon effective. It can also take a few hits thanks to the added body damage, and the maximum speed for everything allows for maximum effectiveness when attacking and defending.

If you want the absolute maximum amount of power out of it and are willing to take risks, this build allows you to have that. Tons of reload to allow for rapid fire cannons and rapid drone regeneration, as well as maxed out speed for everything. However, the 0 health stats makes this glass build a risky one to take when fighting bullet spammers and dragon Tri-Angles.
