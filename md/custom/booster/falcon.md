## 2. Tank Details

The Falcon is a lvl 45 upgrade off of Tri-Angle. Upon upgrading the front cannon is replaced with a sniper cannon, and an extra cannon is added at the rear. It has more maneuverability than fighter due to the extra recoil, but less than booster. This class primarily focuses on mid-to-long range hit and run attacks, where a few shots are landed and then you retreat to a better position.

Standard glass build. Play like a normal glass Fighter or Tri-Angle. Remember that you have your back cannon to assist you when running. Your double bullet speed is crucial in times like this, as you can easily snipe chasing enemies such as Spikes just by getting them to chase you from a little further away.

Standard Ice Build, lots of speed and a little health to tank a few hits. Play conservatively like a glass build to maximize effectiveness. You are designed to hit and run, but you can take a little damage too. Remember not to be too aggressive, even with your health. Use your double bullet speed to your advantage, your 4 bullet speed is equal to 7 on a Fighter. Aim from a distance and play safe.
