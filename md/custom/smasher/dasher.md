## 2. Tank Details

The Dasher is a standard Smasher, but it has the ability to "dash" 25 BgS when the <kbd>R</kbd> key is pressed. It can only dash every 15 seconds, and it cannot turn or reverse direction while dashing. It will dash in the direction it is moving in, and will not stop unless it dies or hits an object such as a maze wall or map border. Other than that, it is your standard Smasher with no other extra stats added.



## 3. Builds

Standard Smasher build. Nothing special, best for maximum power but in exchange for slow regen.

If you want a little faster regen in exchange for barely any power, here you go. Perfect for tap and run tactics.
