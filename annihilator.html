<strong id="guide_title">PEKMEN's Guide to Bullet Annihilator</strong> 
</head>

<br>
So Annihilator branches off of Destroyer at level 45, and has bigger bullets (the size of a lvl 45 tank).
<br>
Also, the reload is slightly worse than with Hybrid. With all these things in mind, let's look at the builds that work the best for it (in my opinion).
<br>
0/0/1/7/7/7/4/7, 0/0/2/7/7/6/4/7, 0/0/0/7/7/6/6/7, 0/0/0/7/7/7/6/6 and 0/1/2/7/7/6/4/6 are the best builds for it.
<br>
As you can see, glassy builds with little health work the best for it, as well as pure glass. So then I'll cover how you fight all classes now.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Bullet spammers</strong> <br>
These are actually pretty easy to deal with if you know what you're doing.
Locate them by following the trail of their bullets and vertically ambush them.
If you fail to hit your enemy, retreat and try again until you kill it. 
Also, note that Destroyers are your best choice to kill annoying Pentashots and Spreadshots.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Rammers</strong> <br>
Rammers can also be a pain in the ass because of their speed, however baiting them is your key to killing them. 
Do that by staying in 1 position (works with dumb rammers) or by having low health. 
However, if facing spikes (which can sometimes take 4 hits to kill), bait them first then chase them because surely they'll try to escape.
However, keep some distance from it as it can use your recoil to kill you. Also cornering them really helps.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3. Drone classes</strong> <br>
To fight these, first off you need the element of surprise. Your best bet is to sneak up to them when they are unaware of your presence or are battling someone else.
With movement speed, recoil and bullets that can take out half of their drones, you've got nothing to worry about.
Glassy builds are your best choice in taking them down, DO NOT try battling them with 0 reload, that's suicide.
<br>
<br>
<strong>4. Trappers</strong> <br>
Trappers are extremely difficult kills due to the power of their traps, but it's not impossible to take them down. Once again, 
the element of surprise if your friend. Remember that it takes 2-3 traps for them to block 1 of your bullets. So the best way to take them down is 
if they are moving towards another direction to lay traps. Don't try to battle them when they've already "built a wall" around them.
<br>
<br>
<strong>5. Snipers</strong> <br>
Snipers are Destroyers' worst enemies, perhaps even more so than Overlord. They've got more FoV than you, 
far more bullet speed and far more range. However, it's still possible to kill them with a good vertical 
ambush or while they are busy fighting a hard enemy to kill (ram Booster for example). If they've got little movement speed, 
then it's not so hard to take them down. If they have 5-7 movement speed it will be tough, so I suggest you stay away until they 
make a mistake or a chance arrives.
<br>
<br>
<strong>6. Destroyers</strong> <br>
Ambushes work as well against Destroyers as they do against everything else. 
Vertical ambush the Destroyer, and if it's got decent reflexes, try waiting for it to use it's recoil, then your chance to kill them arrives.
Also since Destroyers are vulnerable, you can sandwich them between a bullet spammer and yourself and they've got no way out.
