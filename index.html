<a id="annihilator"></a>
<strong id="guide_title">PEKMEN's Guide to Bullet Annihilator</strong> 
<br>
So Annihilator branches off of Destroyer at level 45, and has bigger bullets (the size of a lvl 45 tank).
<br>
Also, the reload is slightly worse than with Hybrid. With all these things in mind, let's look at the builds that work the best for it (in my opinion).
<br>
0/0/1/7/7/7/4/7, 0/0/2/7/7/6/4/7, 0/0/0/7/7/6/6/7, 0/0/0/7/7/7/6/6 and 0/1/2/7/7/6/4/6 are the best builds for it.
<br>
As you can see, glassy builds with little health work the best for it, as well as pure glass. So then I'll cover how you fight all classes now.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Bullet spammers</strong> <br>
These are actually pretty easy to deal with if you know what you're doing.
Locate them by following the trail of their bullets and vertically ambush them.
If you fail to hit your enemy, retreat and try again until you kill it. 
Also, note that Destroyers are your best choice to kill annoying Pentashots and Spreadshots.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Rammers</strong> <br>
Rammers can also be a pain in the ass because of their speed, however baiting them is your key to killing them. 
Do that by staying in 1 position (works with dumb rammers) or by having low health. 
However, if facing spikes (which can sometimes take 4 hits to kill), bait them first then chase them because surely they'll try to escape.
However, keep some distance from it as it can use your recoil to kill you. Also cornering them really helps.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3. Drone classes</strong> <br>
To fight these, first off you need the element of surprise. Your best bet is to sneak up to them when they are unaware of your presence or are battling someone else.
With movement speed, recoil and bullets that can take out half of their drones, you've got nothing to worry about.
Glassy builds are your best choice in taking them down, DO NOT try battling them with 0 reload, that's suicide.
<br>
<br>
<strong>4. Trappers</strong> <br>
Trappers are extremely difficult kills due to the power of their traps, but it's not impossible to take them down. Once again, 
the element of surprise if your friend. Remember that it takes 2-3 traps for them to block 1 of your bullets. So the best way to take them down is 
if they are moving towards another direction to lay traps. Don't try to battle them when they've already "built a wall" around them.
<br>
<br>
<strong>5. Snipers</strong> <br>
Snipers are Destroyers' worst enemies, perhaps even more so than Overlord. They've got more FoV than you, 
far more bullet speed and far more range. However, it's still possible to kill them with a good vertical 
ambush or while they are busy fighting a hard enemy to kill (ram Booster for example). If they've got little movement speed, 
then it's not so hard to take them down. If they have 5-7 movement speed it will be tough, so I suggest you stay away until they 
make a mistake or a chance arrives.
<br>
<br>
<strong>6. Destroyers</strong> <br>
Ambushes work as well against Destroyers as they do against everything else. 
Vertical ambush the Destroyer, and if it's got decent reflexes, try waiting for it to use it's recoil, then your chance to kill them arrives.
Also since Destroyers are vulnerable, you can sandwich them between a bullet spammer and yourself and they've got no way out.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="auto5"></a>
<strong id="guide_title">Donut and brackets' Guide to Auto 5</strong>
<br>
A good build to use would be something along the lines of 00057777 or 00067767
These builds allow you to move fast, shoot quickly, and defend when needed.
You always need to be moving as an Auto 5, as moving around and chasing people is a key factor in the auto 5's strategy.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Bullet Spammers</strong>
<br>
Try to chase after them while staying either east or west of them to get a better view of where you are shooting. Dodge their bullets and let
your auto cannons take control of the situation.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Rammers</strong>
<br>
You want to try to stay to the west or east of them, as this allows you to see where they are coming from and allows you to predict their attacks.
Most rammers underestimate the auto 5 so try baiting them by looking retarded and keeping your auto fire off.
Then when they get close enough turn on the auto fire and move in the opposite direction they are moving.
This will slow them down and prevent them from reaching you and when they try to run you can chase them 
with your bullets and further restrict their movements.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3. Drone Classes</strong>
<br>
Against overlords try to stay on the north or south of them, as your auto cannons can target them even if they can't see you.
Drones can be pesky, so try to move away and dodge them while shooting at them and the overlord, most of them make the mistake 
of ignoring your bullets and end up dying after one attempt.
<br>
<br>
<strong>4. Sniper Branch</strong>
<br>
Snipers are very annoying with auto 5, since it is hard to counter them.
The only tips I have is to try to force them against a wall or corner by using your auto fire to corral them and dodging their bullets at the same time.
If you do have trouble against a good sniper its best to try to run and hope it gets distracted by another player, since snipers are vulnerable to a lot of other tanks.
<br>
<br>
<strong>5. Destroyer Branch</strong>
<br>
Destroyers aren't an exact counter, but it's good and bad at the same time against Auto 5.
If you have auto fire on and its firing somewhere else or your auto gun is targeting something else then it is easy for a hybrid to sneak up and take one good shot.
Most of the time having auto fire off is the best way to fend off a hybrid since they can't get close if the auto cannons keep targeting them.
Once you have them on the defense, do the same thing with them as sniper and corral them into a corner or wall where is it easier to kill them.
<br>
<br>
One thing that hasn't been said is to do with the pentagon nest. 
Auto 5 is one of the best tanks to take into the nest. If you are fighting a dangerous enemy who cannot defend from all sides very well, 
such as an overlord or skilled streamliner, going through the pentagon nest to the other side can either discourage them or cause them to 
be damaged by crashers, which may be crucial when they cross and you fight them. Auto 5 can handle crashers with its auto cannons and clear
any pentagons in the way with manually controlled auto cannons to pass easily, often taking no damage at all even in a big swarm of crashers.

<a id="autosmasher"></a>
<strong id="guide_title">Sunsymbol's Auto Smasher Guide</strong> 
<br>
The Auto Smasher is often looked down on by your average player due to the seemingly stupid combination of a turret and a smasher build.
However, unlike popular belief, the Auto Smasher is actually one of the most useful rammers in the game, with the potential to perform
at an equal or higher level than its competitors, the Spike and Landmine.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Build</strong>
<br>
First off, the build. My personal favorite build is 4/9/10/10.
This build has superior enough power over booster and annihilator rammers that it is able to kill them fairly easily.
It has maximum speed because without that speed, fending off Spikes would be much harder and getting ambushes would be more difficult.
Finally, the 4 regen, combined with the autogun, is important for slowly weakening spikes in order to eventually kill them if they choose to chase you.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Auto Cannon</strong>
<br>
Now, in order to most effectively use Autosmasher, it is important to understand the everything about the turret which makes it unique.
With most Auto tanks, the Autogun gives a combination of three things: Increased power, the ability to be mostly immune to the environment, 
and the ability to track down enemies. Autosmasher is a whole different breed of tank though, 
and its Autogun provides a different set of advantages and weaknesses.
<br>
<br>
Since Autosmasher's turret doesn't actually do almost any damage, other smaller factors about it should be noted.
First off, the turret does have a bit of recoil, which makes moving towards something a very slight bit slower than moving away from something. 
Its gun is pretty weak, meaning that it can lock onto a single shape and fire at it several times before killing it, hence it seems easily distracted. 
It is super weak, but if it does touch the enemy it will stop their high speed regeneration. Finally, it leaves a bit of a trail and 
likes to give away your location quite a bit.
<br>
<br>
So, here comes the good stuff. Covering all the weaknesses of Autosmasher's turret is the first order of business, 
because using Autosmasher effectively works best when the turret is not a disruption. 
<br>
The first major problem is the problem of recoil pushing you back as you approach a target. 
The second is that the gun firing at the enemy tends to give away ambushes. The third problem is that when you actually do want to track the enemy, 
the gun might be busy shooting at another shape. All three of these problems can be solved quite easily actually, and with a fairly simple method. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Just run up to the center of the map, grab all the crashers, and drag them out of the center.</strong>
<br>
<br>
This solves all three weaknesses at once. First off, it forces your turret to fire behind you because the turret prefers crashers over other shapes. 
This both gives you the gun's recoil buff in whatever direction you are running, and also keeps the gun pointing away from ambushes, 
making them more likely to succeed. Finally, you can simply back into your crashers to kill them, letting the turret retarget an enemy 
if you are wanting to track that enemy with the autoradar.
<br>
<br>
Also, the crashers will occasionally catch up to you and touch you, giving you an essentially free speed boost on top of the recoil. 
A combination of a nice crasher cloud and the turret recoil with the 10 movement speed turns Auto Smasher into a real competitor for fastest 
class in the game, allowing it to literally outrun a 10 speed spike, and ambush about as fast as a destroyer bullet.
Finally, availability of crashers is obviously not a problem since they spawn all the time, and with 10 movement speed it's easy to get from 
anywhere on the map back to the center to gather more crashers quickly.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="autotrapper"></a>
<strong id="guide_title">Flameyman, Hunji, and PEKMEN's Guide to Auto Trapper</strong>
<br>
Auto-Trapper is a very diverse class, as it can be used for defense as well as strong attack. 
You may think that you need high bullet Speed for the class to be useful, but that isn't the case. 
Useful builds include 0/0/0/5/7/7/7/7 if you like glass cannons or you could also use the build 2/1/2/3/7/7/6/5. 
Now you may think that this build is surprising because of the low bullet Speed but in fact it's not. 
The Auto Gun is your main attack form and the Auto Gun shoots much faster than the bullet Speed suggests so 
it would be about the equivalent of 4-5 bullet Speed. The low bullet Speed also helps with defense as the trap 
lays closer to you making more of a congested lump around you. Obviously you have to focus on dodging and trap laying 
as the Auto Gun is not controllable.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Counters</strong>
<br>
The Destroyer branch tanks generally don't pose as much of a threat as you'd think, especially considering the builds listed in Part 3.
Most drone classes can't do much if you've laid out an irregular trap field: Overlord/Overseer and Manager can break through a few of your traps,
but so long as you have enough traps to retreat into, you can focus on attacking the drone user, as they are now exposed to your auto turret. 
Battleship, however, can be annoying or even quite dangerous. It doesn't need to destroy your traps - its little drones usually just slide past them. 
If you're working with a more tanky build, this might not be as much of a problem, though it can still be your death eventually. 
Bullet spammers vary, though you could roughly separate them along 2 lines: high versus low bullet speed and large versus small bullets. 
<br>
<br>
Spreadshot and Sprayer actually fall in between as their bullets are not of the same size.
Bullet spammers with large bullets are usually quite powerful. While Triplets and Twins can quite efficiently destroy your traps, 
they are usually vulnerable to your turret at higher bullet speeds. Their bullets do form a solid wall at lower speeds, though. 
<br>
<br>
Pentashot and Octotank could be dangerous... though especially Pentashot will often take several hits from your turret and retreat. 
Streamliner and Auto Gunner fall under small bullets. They have a better chance at hitting you as their bullets 
have a smaller hitbox. While Streamliners can easily push your traps away, the tank's body itself is quite vulnerable. 
Use strafing to your advantage. Auto Gunner doesn't push traps as much, but its bullets are smaller. I'm not quite sure what to think. 
I've mained Auto Gunner and an Auto Trapper's turret is surprisingly strong against it, especially when paired with good trap placement.
<br>
<br>
Factory is the best counter to Auto Trapper. However, Battleship ranks second and is actually harder to 
protect yourself from, while Factory is basically immune to your turret.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Playstyle</strong>
<br>
Now, to be able to effectively play Auto Trapper, you need to know everything about its Auto Gun, because without it, it's just a normal Trapper. 
The Auto Gun is just like any normal one, it will lock on to one target (shape or player) at a time, and will not stop shooting at it unless you go 
outside it's shooting range or until the target is destroyed. Basically, that same Auto Gun is your way of fighting tanks as well. 
<br>
<br>
You shoot traps to defend yourself and dodge bullets, and you let the Auto Gun shoot the enemy down. However it mostly works against slower enemies. 
Don't even bother against faster enemies unless you've got 7 movement speed, in which case you'll 
need to be careful, because the build will most likely be glass.

	<a id="battleship"></a>
	<strong id="guide_title">Face The Music/Faceplant911's Guide to Battleship</strong>
	<br>
	Welcome to the battleship, one of the most controversial and unique classes in diepio. 
	Upgraded from twin flank and overseer, battleship is a class that fights unlike any other. 
	The battleship is also one of the least directly powerful classes in the game, making it a class that needs 
	a fair bit of strategy and some luck to use effectively.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Fighting Rules</strong>
	<br>
1: Fight in such a way that the enemy cannot block your drones, since this makes the weakness of the drones not matter.
	<br>
2: Fight in such a way that the enemy cannot outrun your drones, since this is the only way an enemy can overcome an undodgeable drone.
	<br>
3: Fight with a complete mastery of bullet density so that you can abuse the battleships control of it against enemies.
	<br>
Optionally, there is also a fourth rare but possible occurence:
	<br>
4: Fight against enemies who are both weak and slow enough (for example, a level 30 mid-slow speed twin flank or distracted overlord) that you can simply overpower them to death.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Unblockable Drones</strong>
	<br>
So, first off is fighting so that the enemy cannot block your drones. The first way this happens is if the enemy is bad 
and doesn't even try to block. The 2nd way is to be fighting an enemy without the ability to directly block stuff well or at all. 
For example, an undefended overlord, or a destroyer upgrade, or a rammer, or a sniper, are all essentially unable to block battleship 
drones in large enough amounts to survive. The 3rd way to keep enemies from blocking is to attack really fast from above/below. 
On a good ambush, people will often fail to react until its too late, letting your drones hit the enemy without being blocked. 
The 4th way is control and release. You do this by moving your control drones in an attack pattern slightly different from you 
auto drones, then turning off autofire. This will cause two different main streams of attack which sometimes can't be blocked. 
This plan works better when the enemy doesn't start off shooting at you, since that restricts your directions of attack significantly. 
Therefore, mixing this plan with the aforementioned fast ambush is a good plan. The fifth method of not getting blocked is short repels. 
Using repel is another way to split your drones into two parts followed by turning off autofire again. 
It comes down really to personal perference and situation whether using method 4 or 5 will get more drones to hit the enemy unblocked. 
Finally, method 6, the forced chase. If you get an enemy to follow you by using recoil, it will be pointing its back to you. 
This is an excellent technique to mix 4 or 5, or even 3 and 4 or 3 and 5 with, if people are dumb enough to chase you from above or below your screen with recoil. 
Any enemy who turns around to block won't be able to catch you, and any tank who doesn't block will be pounded.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Preventing Outrunning</strong>
	<br>
Now for the second main fighting point, fighting in a way that enemies can't outrun your drones. 
Some of these overlap with the previous ones, and often when more than one method combines its especially effective. 
1st off for not letting enemies retreat is, once again, vertical ambushes. If you even see an enemy above or below, 
that means they are not running fast enough from you to avoid being hit, or even running at all. 
Therefore, any vertical ambush will definitely be within range of your drones regardless of the enemy. 
Vertical ambushing seems risky, but since your drones tell you where the enemy is through AI before the enemy sees you, 
you can react much faster than they can, so its rare that an enemy will actually strike you back after an ambush. 
Sometimes you don't even need to see the enemy above or below to launch the ambush, but it will still be within reasonable 
range as long as the drones lock onto something above the screen.
	
A way of keeping enemies in range is the scythe. Battleship drones have a good amount of push to them, 
and if you catch a weak enemy in a sideways movement by arcing your drones around them, they won't be able to escape and 
you can drain them to death. Sometimes enemies are conceited and will simply walk into your range. If this is the case, 
all the better for you! Once they are within your range on purpose, you can beat them to death in any way you feel like that 
follows the unblockable guidelines above.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>4. Bullet Density</strong>
	<br>
The third part of fighting is controlling bullet densities. Bullet density basically means how many bullets you can pack 
into a small area, and it only matters when you have already fired several shots.
Now, the density control of battleship can be used in a variety of ways, First off, high enough drone density will increase the 
effect of the drones on hitting the enemy. In order to maximize drone density, you want to be moving towards the target, with your 
stack directly in front of you. Then, you release all your drones at once by turning off autofire for a moment, and the resulting 
cloud that is fired at the enemy will be thick enough to almost instantly kill a glass cannon. You can also fight certain powerful 
enemies by tricking them into thinking your power is low by retreating in order to reduce your density, which will often cause 
overconfident enemies to approach because they think they can handle your drones. Then when you drop a much more powerful high 
density second attack on them, some enemies will completely ignore the drone density and walk right into the hit, which can cause 
immediate death. Another important aspect of this is fighting rammers. When on the retreat, bullet density from fire will be quite 
low, not even remotely enough to keep away a fast rammer. However, you can also keep a very close range stack in order to suddenly 
increase your bullet density for a short moment when you drop the stack on the enemy. In order to effectively do this, when the 
rammer gets very close, put your drone stack slightly to one side of them, then juke in the direction of your drones at the same 
moment you release them. This will stall the rammer just long enough to form another stack in order to hold them off again.
	<br>
	<br>
<strong>5. Counters</strong>
	<br>
Now for some important strategic notes. First off, dragon triangles are essentially a hard counter to battleships. 
If you get killed by a high health-high bullet damage triangle, don't feel bad, its the most unavoidable death for battleships. 
Secondly, well built octotanks are also extremely hard to counter, but you can try to stall them with sudden pushes 
(drone density boosts) till something hopefully interrupts them. Next, try to keep track of the boss at all times on your map, 
since you can't block them very well, so its unsafe to be near them for any reason other than hopefully distracting a powerful enemy. 
If there is a recoil rammer on your map (booster or annihilator) do not move straight up and down in the middle of nowhere, since 
even your maximum density drones will be unlikely to save you if they come straight from above/below.
<br>
<br>
<br>

	<a id="booster"></a>
	<strong id="guide_title">Face The Music/Faceplant911's Guide to Booster</strong>
	<br>
Unlike its compatriot, the fighter, it does not possess the side guns that make fighter a force to be reckoned with in 1v1s. 
However, it does possess the extra backward barrels, which are a real blessing in their own ways.
First off, as many people have come to realize, booster is not in fact faster (noticeably) than fighter in terms of direct 
racing power due to the reduced recoil of each individual back barrel. 
However, the booster has double the acceleration, which is a huge advantage for it.
First off, it makes the booster a much more viable rammer than fighter because it can reset to full speed more easily after 
being hit. Also, the greater acceleration allows it to turn faster, making it more likely to catch a juker.
		<br>
		<br>
	<strong>1. Builds</strong>
	<br>
The most common booster builds I see are these:
		<br>
67700067
	<br>
57700077
	<br>
77700057
		<br>
		<br>
It basically a choice of what type of play you feel like suits you best if you like the ramming playstyle.
Some players prefer greater reload for the increased speed, some prefer greater regen to be a more effective 
threat over time, and some players prefer a balance of the two.
		<br>
		<br>
	<strong>2. Glass Booster</strong>
	<br>
The thing that mainly interests me is the bullet build booster.
Of course, the first notable builds would be glass.
For booster, the massive recoil means glass would most likely not require maxed speed, and also in order to better kill 
things without needing to get close, bullet speed would be optimal. Therefore, my suggested build would be 00077676, 
with enough power and speed to put up an excellent fight vs nearly anything.
		<br>
		<br>
Using glass booster is a totally different game from using glass fighter because side gun strafing is ineffective. 
Therefore, when facing an enemy, you have to try to get them in a position where you can take a free shot or shots at the target with the front gun.
Therefore, sniping, hit and run, and other dastardly tricks will help a lot.
Some enemies will have inferior firepower and you will be able to simply outfight 
them frontally, for these enemies its more of just another spammer battle.
For example, Octotanks, Triple Twins, and other similar tanks will be able to be simply outpenetrated in general.

	<br>
	
Factory is VERY hard. It is so versatile, but hard to control. You have to be a master to master the master.  Are you READY??
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Controls</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLcjGTw9ap0">Attract Demonstration Video</a>
	<br>
When attracting, if the minions are outside of the spin area, they will go towards the cursor's direction until they enter the spin area.
<br>
When attracting, if the minions are inside of the spin area, they will repel until them enter the spin area. 
In this situation, the "attract" works like repel. This allows the minions to move at faster speed with the help 
from the minion's bullet recoil.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhs-EKNY6Fc">Repel and Leash Demonstration Video</a>
	<br>
When repelling, if the minions are outside of the spin area, they will do the general repel (just like other drone tanks).
<br>
When repelling Inside a specific area (I call it "The Leash") (about 1 ~ 4 grid box), the minions will be pulled toward 
the cursor and, will perform just like normal attract of other drone tanks. 
If the mouse is moved too fast, the minions will be unable to follow the leash. 
This allows the minions to move at faster speed with the help from the minion's bullet recoil.
	<br>
	<br>
When repelling in the spin area and outside the leash, the minions will spin clock wise and 
shoot outwards until they escape the spin area. It will move like normal drone tank's repel.
	<br>
	<br>	
Spinning attract: Use attract to spin around the "Spin area" (In this case, because of the special drone movement Factory has, 
the attract is actually repel), shrink the circle in the process, then Repel in the center of 6 minions. 
This usually takes less than 3 seconds. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogn9yrmqL0w">Shooting Star Demonstration Video</a>
	<br>
Shooting Star: use the spinning attract to attract all 6 minions (become a star shape), then charge 
towards the opponent with the minions as shield in front of the Master. When moving toward a direct along with minions 
leashed, if you have the same movement speed as bullet speed (For example, 7 bullet speed and 7 movement speed), 
you don't need to move the mouse because they have the same movement speed as you do.

	<br>
	<strong>2. What to do and what to avoid</strong>
	<br>
And all that, is just the tip of the iceberg of the mess of skills, tactics, builds, practice, 
and everything else that comes with being a factory main.
But the real fun hasn't started yet. Anokuu has most certainly covered the controls, but I am going to cover how 
to actually use those controls.
	<br>
	<br>
	So what factory gains in power it makes up for in an utter lack of ability to use that power effectively without a lot of experience and work in the class.
So in order to use factory effectively, you need to do three things: Learn how to control the drones, learn 
how to use low damage drones effectively, and be able to hit enemies from close range.
	<br>
	<br>
So the important part here is to take advantage of all of factory's power to cover as many of its weaknesses as you can.
The first weakness to be covered is controlling the drones, which is getting back to what I said at the beginning. 
Now looking at Anokuu's huge block of text on controlling drones, it might seem like a daunting task at first. 
But here is the first and most important thing I am going to tell you about that: You can get massive factory 
scores without ever using the right click button.
	<br>
	<br>
I know this because having played factory a large amount and having also watched many youtube 
videos of factory players breaking 500k or more, I have learned that the only time when repelling is 
generally used is to get drones around enemy drone classes and very occasionally finish off a retreating enemy, 
although even then it is uncommon. The other common feature of the right-click, the attracting/shooting star technique, 
is overshadowed by the much simpler technique of point-and click while moving.
	<br>
	<br>
So for me and every other major factory player, the number one technique is simply that: 
point and click while moving. The reason being that when the target for the drones is far away and 
you move to constantly put that target further away, the drones will naturally converge onto a single path, 
creating a group of drones all firing in the same direction.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://streamable.com/q4z3u">Point and Click Technique</a>
	<br>
Using just this type of motion, it is possible to achieve a lot with the factory, in fact most of its viable 
techniques can be achieved with just this technique alone.
It is still a good idea to take to sandbox and mess with the right-click controls since they do occasionally help, 
but those are more extra bonuses you should learn after mastering the moving click in all its forms.
	<br>
	<br>
Here is the other most important part of factory drone control: Aiming past the enemy.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://streamable.com/4afss"><strong>What NOT to do</strong></a>
	<br>
In this section, I placed my mouse directly onto the target spreadshot. 
Because of this , when I got close not only did the drones keep too great a distance for the bullets to have much effect, 
but they also rotated out of the way and left me wide open for getting torn apart by the spreadshot.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://streamable.com/8o013"><strong>What you SHOULD do</strong></a>
	<br>
Notice that in this demonstration I keep my cursor more forward, and when I actually see the target 
I put it way past the target, and because of that the drones did not change directions to give away my body or have weak hits, 
instead finishing off the enemy before even making physical contact.
	<br>
	<br>
While these are obviously simple examples, basically the same concepts apply to most fights in general, 
just with more chasing and more turning. After a bit of practice, you will come to be able to kill basically anything 
in a 1v1 fight, because it doesn't have the power or reaction to stop you.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Final Notes</strong>
	<br>
So after mastering the controls the other two weaknesses, inability to use the drones effectively and necessity to 
get close to a target are still left to be covered. Lucky for us, these two weaknesses actually cancel each other out!
	<br>
	<br>
Here's why: What better way to take advantage of low damage but high health drones than to use them as a shield to get close?
The answer, there isn't! The answer to the second weakness, how to use the drones, is to use them to cover the third weakness, 
needing to get close. Therefore, when fighting most enemies the simplest way to overpower them is to simply walk up guns 
blazing, and use the drones to both get your firepower right in the enemies face where its supposed to be while also protecting 
you from harm by the enemy.

	<a id="fighter"></a>
	<strong id="guide_title">PEKMEN's Guide to Fighter</strong>
	<br>
Now I'll try my best explain to you how you use glass Fighter in 2 and 4-TDM. I'd love to explain how you use it in 
FFA too, but I simply lack the focus to use Fighter in FFA for long periods of time. If you want to git gud with glass Fighter, 
I suggest you read my tips and tricks for using glass Fighter. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Build</strong>
	<br>
First, let's look at the build. Glass Fighters have many builds, such as 0/0/0/5/7/7/7/7, 
0/0/0/6/7/7/7/6, 0/0/0/7/7/7/7/5 etc. Basically, it's up to your preference, but I'll talk about the 
2 builds that I use, 0/0/0/7/7/6/7/6 and 0/0/0/7/7/7/7/5. 
	<br>
	<br>
Now I'll divide tanks into 7 categories and explain to you how you fight each and every one of them. 
You may not believe it, but a good Fighter is capable of fighting any tank in the game.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Bullet Spammers</strong>
	<br>
Now these classes can be tricky to face in combat with Fighter, even killing them is not very easy, 
but it's far from impossible. First, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FIRE AT THEIR BULLETS, YOU ONLY HAVE 1 POWERFUL 
TURRET WHILE THEY SPAM A LOT OF BULLETS. Instead, what you should do is fire at the tank itself from the 
sides where they are vulnerable while strafing and dodging any bullets that can hit you. If they try to run away, 
you have the speed to catch up to them, just don't charge carelessly like an MG Booster would. Basically, repeat 
this process and sooner or later, the bullet spammer will die.
	<br>
	<br>
Now for Pentashots/Spreadshots, they are probably the most tricky class to face as Fighter, but they aren't
capable of killing you unless you get too close, but of course you wouldn't do that if you had a brain. 
To fight them, first keep your distance from them and try shooting at their gaps between their bullets 
(optional: get closer if you want your hit to land, but not too close as they can hit back). Again you have 
the speed and power to do it, so just repeat it and they will die. For better chances at success, trap them 
into a place where they can't run.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Rammers</strong>
	<br>
Fighter is easily the best choice to face these tanks as you've got the speed to chase even 
Boosters and Annihilators and the power to kill them easily. Rammers often underestimate Fighter and it's 
capabilities, so basically just charge at them, BUT DON'T GET TOO CLOSE OTHERWISE THEY COULD RAM YOU. Keep 
firing at them and they will gradually lose health, and keep chasing them and they are all yours. Note: While 
mastering Fighter, expect to die to rammers quite a bit, I died lots of times to them, but now that I've mastered 
Fighter they can't do anything to me.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>4. Drone Classes</strong>
	<br>
Now these classes (except Necro) are extremely hard to kill. Even I have problems killing Overlords nowadays, 
but I'll try my best to explain to you how this is done. First for Necro, just use Hit and Run tactics against 
it to wear it's drones out quickly and go in for the kill when they're out of drones. Now for Manager, it isn't 
nearly as hard to kill as Overlord, use the same tactics as for Necro, the drones' respawn rate can't keep up 
with you. Just remember that 2 drones from them and you're dead. 
	<br>
	<br>
Now for the most pain in the ass class for a Fighter to face, the Overlord! First up don't worry when they send 
their drones at you, you've got the speed to dodge them. If they send out their drones too far, you can charge in 
for the kill (in that case, it's a bad Overlord). Against better Overlords, start firing at their drones 
(acting as their shield) while keeping distance so that you have time to dodge them should the Overlord attack. 
If the Overlord has 0 reload, keep firing at it's drones and eventually their spawners won't be able to keep up with you. 
However, the most advanced technique to fight Overlords is... strafing. Yeah, you just attack the Overlord and 
if they send their drones out, you attack them with your side guns and push them back a bit. Keep repeating that 
(attack with the front cannon for more damage, but less time to react to their attacks), and if they choose to go 
defensive, just fire at their drones and try finding any openings that they leave and they're dead.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>5. Trappers</strong>
	<br>
Now Trappers are arguably the most durable classes in diep.io because of their traps being VERY powerful, 
but in cost of good attack (exceptions are Gunner Trapper and Auto Trapper). What you have to do is fire at 
the Trapper before they "create their wall of defense" (hopefully while none of their teammates are around), 
just keep your distance and fire at them, 2-3 bullets and they are dead. For Gunner Trapper, you have to be even 
more careful as they can aim (unlike Auto Trapper), but remember that their trap firing rate is slower, so use 
that to your advantage. Especially look out for their bullets as they are extremely powerful. Auto Trapper is 
fought just like the rest, just keep your eye on their auto gun and when it attacks you.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>6. Snipers</strong>
	<br>
Unlike you, Snipers fight from distance with fast bullets. What you need to do is use your speed to 
try getting closer to them, not very close but close enough so that you can charge at them and win. The 
only exception to that strategy being Predator. You can't charge at it carelessly as it's got 3 powerful bullets, 
enough to take you out easily. You need to pinpoint their location first (from where they fire), then get closer 
using your speed and fire at them while strafing to dodge their bullets.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>7. Destroyers</strong>
	<br>
In some cases, I'd rather fight an Overlord than Destroyer. Even to this day, Destroyers are 90% of 
my deaths as Fighter. Their speed, along with their 1 shot kill bullets makes them a very formidable foe. 
Keep in mind that they are the biggest threat to you, especially when you don't know where they are as they 
excel in ambush kills. To pinpoint a Destroyer's location, I spam left-click to shoot from my front turret 
without accelerating from my back turrets, and if they are close, they will fire their bullet. When you find 
out where they are, slowly approach them and try trapping them somewhere where they can't run easily (get between 
them and their base), then shoot at them while dodging their bullets. This is not easy, as their bullet outpenetrates 
all of yours, so you have to curve your bullets around theirs to even be able to hit them and keep your distance just 
enough so that you can dodge all of their bullets. 2-4 well placed bullets and they are dead.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>8. Tri-Angles</strong>
	<br>
Now if you're a skilled Fighter with let's say 600k score, naturally people will use the same tank 
as you to try taking you down. So first I'll cover up killing other glass Fighters. Treat an enemy glass Fighter 
like a bullet spammer and rammer at the same time, what I mean is keep your distance from it while not letting it 
get close to you. In most cases it's a game of dodging. So fire at the enemy while keeping your distance and dodge 
any of their bullets that could hit you. 2 well placed shots and they are dead. 
	<br>
	<br>
Now the more complicated enemies, dragon Fighters! The most important thing is to not let them get close to you, 
ALWAYS keep moving and don't stay in 1 place while firing bullets at them. What you need to do is attack it from 
the sides where it's vulnerable while avoiding the front part of it, and if you are about to get hit by it, retreat
a bit and keep firing at its sides. Despite most of the dragons having decent health/body damage, it doesn't take
much bullets from a Fighter to kill other tanks.
