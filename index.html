<a id="annihilator"></a>
<strong id="guide_title">PEKMEN's Guide to Bullet Annihilator</strong> 

<br>

So Annihilator branches off of Destroyer at level 45, and has bigger bullets (the size of a lvl 45 tank).<br>
However, it's big bullets also take more damage over time and are weaker than Hybrid's bullets.<br>
Also, the reload is slightly worse than with Hybrid. With all these things in mind, let's look at the builds that work the best for it (in my opinion).<br>
0/0/1/7/7/7/4/7, 0/0/2/7/7/6/4/7, 0/0/0/7/7/6/6/7, 0/0/0/7/7/7/6/6 and 0/1/2/7/7/6/4/6 are the best builds for it.<br>
As you can see, glassy builds with little health work the best for it, as well as pure glass. So then I'll cover how you fight all classes now.<br>

<br>
<br>

<strong>1. Bullet spammers</strong> <br>
These are actually pretty easy to deal with if you know what you're doing.
Locate them by following the trail of their bullets and vertically ambush them.
If you fail to hit your enemy, retreat and try again until you kill it. 
Also, note that Destroyers are your best choice to kill annoying Pentashots and Spreadshots.

<br>
<br>

<strong>2. Rammers</strong> <br>
Rammers can also be a pain in the ass because of their speed, however baiting them is your key to killing them. 
Do that by staying in 1 position (works with dumb rammers) or by having low health. 
However, if facing spikes (which can sometimes take 4 hits to kill), bait them first then chase them because surely they'll try to escape.
However, keep some distance from it as it can use your recoil to kill you. Also cornering them really helps.

<br>
<br>

<strong>3. Drone classes</strong> <br>
To fight these, first off you need the element of surprise. Your best bet is to sneak up to them when they are unaware of your presence or are battling someone else.
With movement speed, recoil and bullets that can take out half of their drones, you've got nothing to worry about.
Glassy builds are your best choice in taking them down, DO NOT try battling them with 0 reload, that's suicide.

<br>
<br>

<strong>4. Trappers</strong> <br>
Trappers are extremely difficult kills due to the power of their traps, but it's not impossible to take them down. Once again, 
the element of surprise if your friend. Remember that it takes 2-3 traps for them to block 1 of your bullets. So the best way to take them down is 
if they are moving towards another direction to lay traps. Don't try to battle them when they've already "built a wall" around them.

<br>
<br>

<strong>5. Snipers</strong> <br>
Snipers are Destroyers' worst enemies, perhaps even more so than Overlord. They've got more FoV than you, 
far more bullet speed and far more range. However, it's still possible to kill them with a good vertical 
ambush or while they are busy fighting a hard enemy to kill (ram Booster for example). If they've got little movement speed, 
then it's not so hard to take them down. If they have 5-7 movement speed it will be tough, so I suggest you stay away until they 
make a mistake or a chance arrives.

<br>
<br>

<strong>6. Destroyers</strong> <br>
Ambushes work as well against Destroyers as they do against everything else. 
Vertical ambush the Destroyer, and if it's got decent reflexes, try waiting for it to use it's recoil, then your chance to kill them arrives.
Also since Destroyers are vulnerable, you can sandwich them between a bullet spammer and yourself and they've got no way out.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<a id="auto5"></a>
<strong id="guide_title">Donut and brackets' Guide to Auto 5</strong>
<br>
A good build to use would be something along the lines of 00057777 or 00067767
These builds allow you to move fast, shoot quickly, and defend when needed.
You always need to be moving as an Auto 5, as moving around and chasing people is a key factor in the auto 5's strategy.

<br>
<br>

<strong>1. Bullet Spammers</strong>

<br>

Try to chase after them while staying either east or west of them to get a better view of where you are shooting. Dodge their bullets and let
your auto cannons take control of the situation.

<br>
<br>

<strong>2. Rammers</strong>
<br>
You want to try to stay to the west or east of them, as this allows you to see where they are coming from and allows you to predict their attacks.

Most rammers underestimate the auto 5 so try baiting them by looking retarded and keeping your auto fire off.

Then when they get close enough turn on the auto fire and move in the opposite direction they are moving.

This will slow them down and prevent them from reaching you and when they try to run you can chase them 
with your bullets and further restrict their movements.

<br>
<br>

<strong>3. Drone Classes</strong>

<br>

Against overlords try to stay on the north or south of them, as your auto cannons can target them even if they can't see you.
Drones can be pesky, so try to move away and dodge them while shooting at them and the overlord, most of them make the mistake 
of ignoring your bullets and end up dying after one attempt.

<br>
<br>


<strong>4. Sniper Branch</strong>

<br>

Snipers are very annoying with auto 5, since it is hard to counter them.
The only tips I have is to try to force them against a wall or corner by using your auto fire to corral them and dodging their bullets at the same time.
If you do have trouble against a good sniper its best to try to run and hope it gets distracted by another player, since snipers are vulnerable to a lot of other tanks.

<br>
<br>

<strong>5. Destroyer Branch</strong>

<br>

Destroyers aren't an exact counter, but it's good and bad at the same time against Auto 5.
If you have auto fire on and its firing somewhere else or your auto gun is targeting something else then it is easy for a hybrid to sneak up and take one good shot.
Most of the time having auto fire off is the best way to fend off a hybrid since they can't get close if the auto cannons keep targeting them.
Once you have them on the defense, do the same thing with them as sniper and corral them into a corner or wall where is it easier to kill them.

<br>
<br>

One thing that hasn't been said is to do with the pentagon nest. 
Auto 5 is one of the best tanks to take into the nest. If you are fighting a dangerous enemy who cannot defend from all sides very well, 
such as an overlord or skilled streamliner, going through the pentagon nest to the other side can either discourage them or cause them to 
be damaged by crashers, which may be crucial when they cross and you fight them. Auto 5 can handle crashers with its auto cannons and clear
any pentagons in the way with manually controlled auto cannons to pass easily, often taking no damage at all even in a big swarm of crashers.

<a id="autosmasher"></a>
<strong id="guide_title">Sunsymbol's Auto Smasher Guide</strong> 
<br>
The Auto Smasher is often looked down on by your average player due to the seemingly stupid combination of a turret and a smasher build.
However, unlike popular belief, the Auto Smasher is actually one of the most useful rammers in the game, with the potential to perform
at an equal or higher level than its competitors, the Spike and Landmine.

<br>
<br>

<strong>1. Build</strong>

<br>

First off, the build. My personal favorite build is 4/9/10/10.
This build has superior enough power over booster and annihilator rammers that it is able to kill them fairly easily.
It has maximum speed because without that speed, fending off Spikes would be much harder and getting ambushes would be more difficult.
Finally, the 4 regen, combined with the autogun, is important for slowly weakening spikes in order to eventually kill them if they choose to chase you.

<br>
<br>

<strong>2. Auto Cannon</strong>

<br>

Now, in order to most effectively use Autosmasher, it is important to understand the everything about the turret which makes it unique.
With most Auto tanks, the Autogun gives a combination of three things: Increased power, the ability to be mostly immune to the environment, 
and the ability to track down enemies. Autosmasher is a whole different breed of tank though, 
and its Autogun provides a different set of advantages and weaknesses.

<br>
<br>

Since Autosmasher's turret doesn't actually do almost any damage, other smaller factors about it should be noted.
First off, the turret does have a bit of recoil, which makes moving towards something a very slight bit slower than moving away from something. 
Its gun is pretty weak, meaning that it can lock onto a single shape and fire at it several times before killing it, hence it seems easily distracted. 
It is super weak, but if it does touch the enemy it will stop their high speed regeneration. Finally, it leaves a bit of a trail and 
likes to give away your location quite a bit.

<br>
<br>

So, here comes the good stuff. Covering all the weaknesses of Autosmasher's turret is the first order of business, 
because using Autosmasher effectively works best when the turret is not a disruption. 

<br>

The first major problem is the problem of recoil pushing you back as you approach a target. 
The second is that the gun firing at the enemy tends to give away ambushes. The third problem is that when you actually do want to track the enemy, 
the gun might be busy shooting at another shape. All three of these problems can be solved quite easily actually, and with a fairly simple method. 

<br>
<br>

<strong>Just run up to the center of the map, grab all the crashers, and drag them out of the center.</strong>

<br>
<br>

This solves all three weaknesses at once. First off, it forces your turret to fire behind you because the turret prefers crashers over other shapes. 
This both gives you the gun's recoil buff in whatever direction you are running, and also keeps the gun pointing away from ambushes, 
making them more likely to succeed. Finally, you can simply back into your crashers to kill them, letting the turret retarget an enemy 
if you are wanting to track that enemy with the autoradar.

<br>
<br>

Also, the crashers will occasionally catch up to you and touch you, giving you an essentially free speed boost on top of the recoil. 
A combination of a nice crasher cloud and the turret recoil with the 10 movement speed turns Auto Smasher into a real competitor for fastest 
class in the game, allowing it to literally outrun a 10 speed spike, and ambush about as fast as a destroyer bullet.
Finally, availability of crashers is obviously not a problem since they spawn all the time, and with 10 movement speed it's easy to get from 
anywhere on the map back to the center to gather more crashers quickly.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<a id="autotrapper"></a>
<strong id="guide_title">Flameyman, Hunji, and PEKMEN's Guide to Auto Trapper</strong>
<br>
Auto-Trapper is a very diverse class, as it can be used for defense as well as strong attack. 
You may think that you need high bullet Speed for the class to be useful, but that isn't the case. 
Useful builds include 0/0/0/5/7/7/7/7 if you like glass cannons or you could also use the build 2/1/2/3/7/7/6/5. 
Now you may think that this build is surprising because of the low bullet Speed but in fact it's not. 
The Auto Gun is your main attack form and the Auto Gun shoots much faster than the bullet Speed suggests so 
it would be about the equivalent of 4-5 bullet Speed. The low bullet Speed also helps with defense as the trap 
lays closer to you making more of a congested lump around you. Obviously you have to focus on dodging and trap laying 
as the Auto Gun is not controllable.

<br>
<br>

<strong>1. Counters</strong>

<br>

The Destroyer branch tanks generally don't pose as much of a threat as you'd think, especially considering the builds listed in Part 3.
Most drone classes can't do much if you've laid out an irregular trap field: Overlord/Overseer and Manager can break through a few of your traps,
but so long as you have enough traps to retreat into, you can focus on attacking the drone user, as they are now exposed to your auto turret. 
Battleship, however, can be annoying or even quite dangerous. It doesn't need to destroy your traps - its little drones usually just slide past them. 
If you're working with a more tanky build, this might not be as much of a problem, though it can still be your death eventually. 
Bullet spammers vary, though you could roughly separate them along 2 lines: high versus low bullet speed and large versus small bullets. 

<br>
<br>

Spreadshot and Sprayer actually fall in between as their bullets are not of the same size.
Bullet spammers with large bullets are usually quite powerful. While Triplets and Twins can quite efficiently destroy your traps, 
they are usually vulnerable to your turret at higher bullet speeds. Their bullets do form a solid wall at lower speeds, though. 

<br>
<br>

Pentashot and Octotank could be dangerous... though especially Pentashot will often take several hits from your turret and retreat. 
Streamliner and Auto Gunner fall under small bullets. They have a better chance at hitting you as their bullets 
have a smaller hitbox. While Streamliners can easily push your traps away, the tank's body itself is quite vulnerable. 
Use strafing to your advantage. Auto Gunner doesn't push traps as much, but its bullets are smaller. I'm not quite sure what to think. 
I've mained Auto Gunner and an Auto Trapper's turret is surprisingly strong against it, especially when paired with good trap placement.

<br>
<br>

Factory is the best counter to Auto Trapper. However, Battleship ranks second and is actually harder to 
protect yourself from, while Factory is basically immune to your turret.

<br>
<br>

<strong>2. Playstyle</strong>
<br>
Now, to be able to effectively play Auto Trapper, you need to know everything about its Auto Gun, because without it, it's just a normal Trapper. 
The Auto Gun is just like any normal one, it will lock on to one target (shape or player) at a time, and will not stop shooting at it unless you go 
outside it's shooting range or until the target is destroyed. Basically, that same Auto Gun is your way of fighting tanks as well. 

<br>
<br>

You shoot traps to defend yourself and dodge bullets, and you let the Auto Gun shoot the enemy down. However it mostly works against slower enemies. 
Don't even bother against faster enemies unless you've got 7 movement speed, in which case you'll 
need to be careful, because the build will most likely be glass.

<br>

	<a id="battleship"></a>
	<strong id="guide_title">Face The Music/Faceplant911's Guide to Battleship</strong>
	<br>
	Welcome to the battleship, one of the most controversial and unique classes in diepio. 
	Upgraded from twin flank and overseer, battleship is a class that fights unlike any other. 
	The battleship is also one of the least directly powerful classes in the game, making it a class that needs 
	a fair bit of strategy and some luck to use effectively.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Fighting Rules</strong>
	<br>
1: Fight in such a way that the enemy cannot block your drones, since this makes the weakness of the drones not matter.
	<br>
2: Fight in such a way that the enemy cannot outrun your drones, since this is the only way an enemy can overcome an undodgeable drone.
	<br>
3: Fight with a complete mastery of bullet density so that you can abuse the battleships control of it against enemies.
	<br>
Optionally, there is also a fourth rare but possible occurence:
	<br>
4: Fight against enemies who are both weak and slow enough (for example, a level 30 mid-slow speed twin flank or distracted overlord) that you can simply overpower them to death.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Unblockable Drones</strong>
	<br>
So, first off is fighting so that the enemy cannot block your drones. The first way this happens is if the enemy is bad 
and doesn't even try to block. The 2nd way is to be fighting an enemy without the ability to directly block stuff well or at all. 
For example, an undefended overlord, or a destroyer upgrade, or a rammer, or a sniper, are all essentially unable to block battleship 
drones in large enough amounts to survive. The 3rd way to keep enemies from blocking is to attack really fast from above/below. 
On a good ambush, people will often fail to react until its too late, letting your drones hit the enemy without being blocked. 
The 4th way is control and release. You do this by moving your control drones in an attack pattern slightly different from you 
auto drones, then turning off autofire. This will cause two different main streams of attack which sometimes can't be blocked. 
This plan works better when the enemy doesn't start off shooting at you, since that restricts your directions of attack significantly. 
Therefore, mixing this plan with the aforementioned fast ambush is a good plan. The fifth method of not getting blocked is short repels. 
Using repel is another way to split your drones into two parts followed by turning off autofire again. 
It comes down really to personal perference and situation whether using method 4 or 5 will get more drones to hit the enemy unblocked. 
Finally, method 6, the forced chase. If you get an enemy to follow you by using recoil, it will be pointing its back to you. 
This is an excellent technique to mix 4 or 5, or even 3 and 4 or 3 and 5 with, if people are dumb enough to chase you from above or below your screen with recoil. 
Any enemy who turns around to block won't be able to catch you, and any tank who doesn't block will be pounded.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Preventing Outrunning</strong>
	<br>
Now for the second main fighting point, fighting in a way that enemies can't outrun your drones. 
Some of these overlap with the previous ones, and often when more than one method combines its especially effective. 
1st off for not letting enemies retreat is, once again, vertical ambushes. If you even see an enemy above or below, 
that means they are not running fast enough from you to avoid being hit, or even running at all. 
Therefore, any vertical ambush will definitely be within range of your drones regardless of the enemy. 
Vertical ambushing seems risky, but since your drones tell you where the enemy is through AI before the enemy sees you, 
you can react much faster than they can, so its rare that an enemy will actually strike you back after an ambush. 
Sometimes you don't even need to see the enemy above or below to launch the ambush, but it will still be within reasonable 
range as long as the drones lock onto something above the screen.
	
A way of keeping enemies in range is the scythe. Battleship drones have a good amount of push to them, 
and if you catch a weak enemy in a sideways movement by arcing your drones around them, they won't be able to escape and 
you can drain them to death. Sometimes enemies are conceited and will simply walk into your range. If this is the case, 
all the better for you! Once they are within your range on purpose, you can beat them to death in any way you feel like that 
follows the unblockable guidelines above.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>4. Bullet Density</strong>
	<br>
The third part of fighting is controlling bullet densities. Bullet density basically means how many bullets you can pack 
into a small area, and it only matters when you have already fired several shots.
Now, the density control of battleship can be used in a variety of ways, First off, high enough drone density will increase the 
effect of the drones on hitting the enemy. In order to maximize drone density, you want to be moving towards the target, with your 
stack directly in front of you. Then, you release all your drones at once by turning off autofire for a moment, and the resulting 
cloud that is fired at the enemy will be thick enough to almost instantly kill a glass cannon. You can also fight certain powerful 
enemies by tricking them into thinking your power is low by retreating in order to reduce your density, which will often cause 
overconfident enemies to approach because they think they can handle your drones. Then when you drop a much more powerful high 
density second attack on them, some enemies will completely ignore the drone density and walk right into the hit, which can cause 
immediate death. Another important aspect of this is fighting rammers. When on the retreat, bullet density from fire will be quite 
low, not even remotely enough to keep away a fast rammer. However, you can also keep a very close range stack in order to suddenly 
increase your bullet density for a short moment when you drop the stack on the enemy. In order to effectively do this, when the 
rammer gets very close, put your drone stack slightly to one side of them, then juke in the direction of your drones at the same 
moment you release them. This will stall the rammer just long enough to form another stack in order to hold them off again.
	<br>
	<br>
<strong>5. Counters</strong>
	<br>
Now for some important strategic notes. First off, dragon triangles are essentially a hard counter to battleships. 
If you get killed by a high health-high bullet damage triangle, don't feel bad, its the most unavoidable death for battleships. 
Secondly, well built octotanks are also extremely hard to counter, but you can try to stall them with sudden pushes 
(drone density boosts) till something hopefully interrupts them. Next, try to keep track of the boss at all times on your map, 
since you can't block them very well, so its unsafe to be near them for any reason other than hopefully distracting a powerful enemy. 
If there is a recoil rammer on your map (booster or annihilator) do not move straight up and down in the middle of nowhere, since 
even your maximum density drones will be unlikely to save you if they come straight from above/below.
