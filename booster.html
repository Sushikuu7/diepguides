<strong id="guide_title">Face The Music/Faceplant911's Guide to Booster</strong>
</head>
 
<br>
Unlike its compatriot, the fighter, it does not possess the side guns that make fighter a force to be reckoned with in 1v1s. 
However, it does possess the extra backward barrels, which are a real blessing in their own ways.
First off, as many people have come to realize, booster is not in fact faster (noticeably) than fighter in terms of direct 
racing power due to the reduced recoil of each individual back barrel. 
However, the booster has double the acceleration, which is a huge advantage for it.
First off, it makes the booster a much more viable rammer than fighter because it can reset to full speed more easily after 
being hit. Also, the greater acceleration allows it to turn faster, making it more likely to catch a juker.
		<br>
		<br>
	<strong>1. Builds</strong>
	<br>
The most common booster builds I see are these:
		<br>
67700067
	<br>
57700077
	<br>
77700057
		<br>
		<br>
It's basically a choice of what type of play you feel like suits you best if you like the ramming playstyle.
Some players prefer greater reload for the increased speed, some prefer greater regen to be a more effective 
threat over time, and some players prefer a balance of the two.
		<br>
		<br>
	<strong>2. Glass Booster</strong>
	<br>
The thing that mainly interests me is the bullet build booster.
Of course, the first notable builds would be glass.
For booster, the massive recoil means glass would most likely not require maxed speed, and also in order to better kill 
things without needing to get close, bullet speed would be optimal. Therefore, my suggested build would be 00077676, 
with enough power and speed to put up an excellent fight vs nearly anything.
		<br>
		<br>
Using glass booster is a totally different game from using glass fighter because side gun strafing is ineffective. 
Therefore, when facing an enemy, you have to try to get them in a position where you can take a free shot or shots at the target with the front gun.
Therefore, sniping, hit and run, and other dastardly tricks will help a lot.
Some enemies will have inferior firepower and you will be able to simply outfight 
them frontally, for these enemies its more of just another spammer battle.
For example, Octotanks, Triple Twins, and other similar tanks will be able to be simply outpenetrated in general.
