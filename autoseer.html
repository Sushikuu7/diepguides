<strong id="guide_title">Autoseer Concept</strong>
<br>
<br>
Many people have suggested the idea of an Autoseer, but their designs were always Overseer with an auto turret slapped onto it. It was too powerful, and not many people made it realistic. This is fixed with a new design, similar to Manager's, but with an auto cannon on top. In exchange for invisibility, it will instead have an auto cannon to defend itself with.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Auto Cannon</strong>
<br>
Unlike many auto cannon tanks, the auto cannon on this tank is probably the most effective item it has for defense. Because of its slow reload, if it runs out of drones, it will take a while for it to get all of them back. It cannot protect itself at that time, and protecting the tank is what that auto cannon does. The auto cannon will be the standard auto cannon found on Auto Gunner, Auto Trapper, etc. It can be used to clear out shapes while using your drones to defend yourself as your retreat, and is just a helpful form of instant self defense that is not always found in drones.

	<strong>2. Power Comparison</strong>
	<br>
In terms of power gained from the auto turret, it is very similar to Auto Trapper and Auto Gunner. Without the auto turret, the tank is much weaker. The auto turret helps counter that weakness. Trapper has no means of attack other than its traps, and nobody is stupid enough to run into those (excluding suicide). Auto Trapper's auto cannon allows it to attack while the player focuses on defense, forming a deadly combo. Gunner is a focused fire tank, and already having weak bullets, it cannot cover more than area at once. If it has 2 or more enemies trying to kill it, it will be very difficult for the Gunner. The auto cannon lets it cover that weakness. For the Overseer, once you catch it with its drones away, it is usually an easy kill for most tanks. The auto cannon allows for instant defense in these situations, which can be the difference between life and death. While it stalls with the auto cannon, the tank can regain its drones to counterattack or use as a shield. Similar to the Gunner and Trapper, the Overseer needs that cannon as an essential
