<strong id="guide_title">Autoseer Concept</strong>
<br>
<br>
Many people have suggested the idea of an Autoseer, but their designs were always Overseer with an auto turret slapped onto it. It was too powerful, and not many people made it realistic. This is fixed with a new design, similar to Manager's, but with an auto cannon on top. In exchange for invisibility, it will instead have an auto cannon to defend itself with.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Auto Cannon</strong>
<br>
Unlike many auto cannon tanks, the auto cannon on this tank is probably the most effective item it has for defense. Because of its slow reload, if it runs out of drones, it will take a while for it to get all of them back. It cannot protect itself at that time, and protecting the tank is what that auto cannon does.
