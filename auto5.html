</head>
 
<br>
A good build to use would be something along the lines of 00057777 or 00067767
These builds allow you to move fast, shoot quickly, and defend when needed.
You always need to be moving as an Auto 5, as moving around and chasing people is a key factor in the auto 5's strategy.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Bullet Spammers</strong>
<br>
Try to chase after them while staying either east or west of them to get a better view of where you are shooting. Dodge their bullets and let
your auto cannons take control of the situation.
<br>
<br>
<strong>2. Rammers</strong>
<br>
You want to try to stay to the west or east of them, as this allows you to see where they are coming from and allows you to predict their attacks.
Most rammers underestimate the auto 5 so try baiting them by looking retarded and keeping your auto fire off.
Then when they get close enough turn on the auto fire and move in the opposite direction they are moving.
This will slow them down and prevent them from reaching you and when they try to run you can chase them 
with your bullets and further restrict their movements.
<br>
<br>
<strong>3. Drone Classes</strong>
<br>
Against overlords try to stay on the north or south of them, as your auto cannons can target them even if they can't see you.
Drones can be pesky, so try to move away and dodge them while shooting at them and the overlord, most of them make the mistake 
of ignoring your bullets and end up dying after one attempt.
<br>
<br>
<strong>4. Sniper Branch</strong>
<br>
Snipers are very annoying with auto 5, since it is hard to counter them.
The only tips I have is to try to force them against a wall or corner by using your auto fire to corral them and dodging their bullets at the same time.
If you do have trouble against a good sniper its best to try to run and hope it gets distracted by another player, since snipers are vulnerable to a lot of other tanks.
<br>
<br>
<strong>5. Destroyer Branch</strong>
<br>
Destroyers aren't an exact counter, but it's good and bad at the same time against Auto 5.
If you have auto fire on and its firing somewhere else or your auto gun is targeting something else then it is easy for a hybrid to sneak up and take one good shot.
Most of the time having auto fire off is the best way to fend off a hybrid since they can't get close if the auto cannons keep targeting them.
Once you have them on the defense, do the same thing with them as sniper and corral them into a corner or wall where is it easier to kill them.
<br>
<br>
One thing that hasn't been said is to do with the pentagon nest. 
Auto 5 is one of the best tanks to take into the nest. If you are fighting a dangerous enemy who cannot defend from all sides very well, 
such as an overlord or skilled streamliner, going through the pentagon nest to the other side can either discourage them or cause them to 
be damaged by crashers, which may be crucial when they cross and you fight them. Auto 5 can handle crashers with its auto cannons and clear
any pentagons in the way with manually controlled auto cannons to pass easily, often taking no damage at all even in a big swarm of crashers.
