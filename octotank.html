	<h2>2. Basics</h2>
	<br>
Octotank is a tank that branches off from quad tank at level 45. At one point it also branched off of twin flank, but it has been removed from that spot a few updates ago. So lets take a look at the class paths that are taken to get to octotank, as octotank keeps some traits from them. The only trait the octotank keeps from basic is the reload cycle, so every barrel has a reload cycle equal to a basic tank. The first two classes that can become octotanks are twin and flankguard. Twin is the class that looks the least like octotank, but octotank receives its most important trait from this class, the bullet stats. Every octotank bullet is equal to a twin bullet in terms of bullet speed, bullet penetration, and bullet damage. 
	<br>
	<br>
Next up, the flank guard is just a basic tank with a back cannon that also has the power of a basic tank. The trait given here is the start of cannons appearing on multiple sides of the tank to protect it from being flanked on both sides. The second trait given is that the octotank receives an equal amount of recoil on both sides, meaning that both of these clsses can't recoil in any direction with a positive or negative net of speed thanks to cannons being on multiple sides. The final trait that it inherits is actually given from the original flankguard, which is the firing pattern of the tanks. 
	<br>
	<br>
Flankguard used to shoot its front cannon first, then shoot its back cannon in half of a reload cycle later. This would lead to having both cannons firing once after the other, which is what the octotank still does and part of what makes it great. The quad tank, the only lvl 30 tank branching to the octotank, only gives the trait of having more barrels that do less power in the shape of a +.
	<br>
	<br>
Although the quad tank has more power than a octotank bullet, twin bullet, it has less power than a flankguard bullet and basic tank bullet. Finally we arrive at the octotank. With all of this, the octotank has 8 barrels, and the two groups of 4 barrels shoot consecutively in a + formation. The bullet themselves have the reload of a basic tank but the power and speed of a twin. There is no recoil to be had with this tank, so its only source of speed is the points you put into its Movement Speed.
	<br>
	<br>
Now then, octotank has a family group it belongs in as a level 45 class. Its a balanced tank in the AoE family tree. By AoE, I mean area of spam, which are all tanks that practically make a bullet hell all around them whenever they are shooting. Although the other tanks in this tree do it decently (auto 5, tripletwin, tri-trapper) Octotank is one of the best at it since it has barrels in every direction with high power, speed, and reload. Now that you know what it means when we say octotank is an AoE tank, lets explain what makes it part of the balanced path of this branch. 
	<br>
	<br>
Balanced paths are tanks that have the ability to be both offensive and defensive at the same time, and they usually excel at doing this without needing to pivot between offense or defense. They can still pivot, but they were made to be both at once. (an example being overlord, which can be both offensive or defensive which is a pivot tank, vs a factory, which is a balanced tank that protects itself while going offensive.) 
	<br>
	<br>
When an octotank shoots, the bullet pattern + the area the barrels covered usually blankets the area with bullets, causing incoming bullets to hit the bullets it shoots as they come into the bullet storm. As bullets hit this storm, they lose health and the amount of damage they will do in total. This is why most octotanks have lower bullet speeds. 
	<br>
	<br>
Aside from having higher MS (movement speed) for dodging usually, the lower bullet speeds cause the bullet density of the bullet storm to increase, although it loses range it gains a natural shield of bullets highly reducing the bullet damage of incoming bullets, if not destroying them first sometimes. While this is occurring, enemies within the bullet storm's range are forced to dodge incoming bullets while trying to hit the octotank as well.
	<br>
	<br>
	Well, last time this was the transition from the overview to the three "stances" of Octotank. This time, however, I will transition to the basic playstyle and techniques of Octotank here. You will find some of the old stances were techniques, so don't be surprised to see them here. First, I will start with one of the most basic and important techniques for tanks like octotank, the stacking technique used with Predator. I will say this right now, on its own this technique might not seem to be the best, but when paired with other techniques I will explain later, it can improve them highly (so just think of this as a support technique that supports other techniques rather than other players). 
	<br>
	<br>
	To perform this technique, first you want to tap the fire button so that only the first group of bullets fire in a + pattern. Now, you want to press and hold the fire button after doing this, just make sure you don't wait until after the cooldown for the cannons you just fired is over. "What will this accomplish?" you might be thinking if you are new to this technique. 
	<br>
	<br>
	For those who are new, this causes the second group to fire when you next press the fire button, and then the first group will fire when the cooldown expires. As long as you don't stop shooting, this will result in a new bullet pattern caused by when the two groups fire compared to each other This can be anywhere from a minimal difference between the original firerate compared to the older one, or something like both groups firing at once as if they were one group. 
	<br>
	<br>
	What is happening (so you understand it a little better) is that you are changing when the second group fires, which changes when its cooldown ends compared to the first group. When this happens, the two groups will start firing in new patterns based on when the cooldown for the second group was started. Once again, by itself this will seem to be useless, but when used in conjunction with the other techniques you will see the true use of this technique.
