<strong id="guide_title">Mega Smasher Concept (Revival)</strong>
<br>
<br>
The Mega Smasher was one of the most powerful Smashers in game, as it was able to easily break through bullet knockback and wreck bullet spammers. It was one of the most exciting classes to play, but sadly the dev removed it. 
To be honest, that reasoning that Zeach had was lame. If you wanted to remove the knockback for the smasher class, why remove the Mega Smasher too? Each smasher should have its own special ability, with Spike and its 2 extra body damage, Landmine and its invisibility, and Auto Smasher with its auto turret. Mega Smasher had its own ability, knockback reduction. But why remove it? To fix this, we need to bring back Mega Smasher. It is currently impossible to kill an intelligent bullet spammer with a Smasher. Bringing back Mega Smasher easily fixes this problem.
<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Power Changes</strong>
<br>
Nobody knows the original amount of knockback reduction that Mega Smasher had, but to keep it fair, it should come back with around 75% knockback reduction. This makes it possible for the Mega Smasher to break through the bullet stream, but still allows bullet spammers to push them back. This way, it can have its own little ability while keeping it useful, unlike Auto Smasher's auto turret.
