<strong id="guide_title">Reaper Concept</strong>
<br>
<br>
The Reaper is a simple drone class that will branch off of Overseer (I know, too many upgrades). It will be fairly powerful, and can easily match the power of an Overlord if used right. Its drones are square, and when it is immobile for 2 seconds, it will disguise itself to look like a large square, and its drones will look like normal squares with more health than you would expect. A normal player might not notice this, but more experienced players can see through this immediately. But other than this, what can it do? What makes this different from Necromancer and Overlord? Let me explain.
  <br>
  <br>
<strong>1. Stats and Strength</strong>
<br>
It spawns drones itself, and can control up to 12 drones. Each drone has the power of 1.1 pentagon (for reference, and overlord drone is 1.6 pentagon, necromancer drone is 0.9, and factory is 3.2). If we were to compare raw stats, it would stack up like this:
<br>
<br>
1: Factory - 19.6 pentagon equivalent drone power
<br>
<br>
2: Necromancer (0 Reload) - 16.2 pentagon equivalent drone power
<br>
Necromancer (7 Reload) - 28.8 pentagon equivalent drone power
<br>
<br>
3: Reaper - 13.2 pentagon equivalent drone power
<br>
<br>
4: Overlord - 12.8 pentagon equivalent drone power
<br>
<br>
It can easily overpower an Overlord by just sending its drones at it, so to balance this, it will have 10% slower drones. Necromancer has 50% slower drones in exchange for its massive drone count, and in exchange for its disguising ability, it will have its drones become 10% slower. It will have the same reload as Overlord and become the 7th upgrade in the Overseer branch.
