</head>
 
<br>
	Welcome to the battleship, one of the most controversial and unique classes in diepio. 
	Upgraded from twin flank and overseer, battleship is a class that fights unlike any other. 
	The battleship is also one of the least directly powerful classes in the game, making it a class that needs 
	a fair bit of strategy and some luck to use effectively.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Fighting Rules</strong>
	<br>
1: Fight in such a way that the enemy cannot block your drones, since this makes the weakness of the drones not matter.
	<br>
2: Fight in such a way that the enemy cannot outrun your drones, since this is the only way an enemy can overcome an undodgeable drone.
	<br>
3: Fight with a complete mastery of bullet density so that you can abuse the battleships control of it against enemies.
	<br>
Optionally, there is also a fourth rare but possible occurence:
	<br>
4: Fight against enemies who are both weak and slow enough (for example, a level 30 mid-slow speed twin flank or distracted overlord) that you can simply overpower them to death.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>2. Unblockable Drones</strong>
	<br>
So, first off is fighting so that the enemy cannot block your drones. The first way this happens is if the enemy is bad 
and doesn't even try to block. The 2nd way is to be fighting an enemy without the ability to directly block stuff well or at all. 
For example, an undefended overlord, or a destroyer upgrade, or a rammer, or a sniper, are all essentially unable to block battleship 
drones in large enough amounts to survive. The 3rd way to keep enemies from blocking is to attack really fast from above/below. 
On a good ambush, people will often fail to react until its too late, letting your drones hit the enemy without being blocked. 
The 4th way is control and release. You do this by moving your control drones in an attack pattern slightly different from you 
auto drones, then turning off autofire. This will cause two different main streams of attack which sometimes can't be blocked. 
This plan works better when the enemy doesn't start off shooting at you, since that restricts your directions of attack significantly. 
Therefore, mixing this plan with the aforementioned fast ambush is a good plan. The fifth method of not getting blocked is short repels. 
Using repel is another way to split your drones into two parts followed by turning off autofire again. 
It comes down really to personal perference and situation whether using method 4 or 5 will get more drones to hit the enemy unblocked. 
Finally, method 6, the forced chase. If you get an enemy to follow you by using recoil, it will be pointing its back to you. 
This is an excellent technique to mix 4 or 5, or even 3 and 4 or 3 and 5 with, if people are dumb enough to chase you from above or below your screen with recoil. 
Any enemy who turns around to block won't be able to catch you, and any tank who doesn't block will be pounded.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Preventing Outrunning</strong>
	<br>
Now for the second main fighting point, fighting in a way that enemies can't outrun your drones. 
Some of these overlap with the previous ones, and often when more than one method combines its especially effective. 
1st off for not letting enemies retreat is, once again, vertical ambushes. If you even see an enemy above or below, 
that means they are not running fast enough from you to avoid being hit, or even running at all. 
Therefore, any vertical ambush will definitely be within range of your drones regardless of the enemy. 
Vertical ambushing seems risky, but since your drones tell you where the enemy is through AI before the enemy sees you, 
you can react much faster than they can, so its rare that an enemy will actually strike you back after an ambush. 
Sometimes you don't even need to see the enemy above or below to launch the ambush, but it will still be within reasonable 
range as long as the drones lock onto something above the screen.
	
A way of keeping enemies in range is the scythe. Battleship drones have a good amount of push to them, 
and if you catch a weak enemy in a sideways movement by arcing your drones around them, they won't be able to escape and 
you can drain them to death. Sometimes enemies are conceited and will simply walk into your range. If this is the case, 
all the better for you! Once they are within your range on purpose, you can beat them to death in any way you feel like that 
follows the unblockable guidelines above.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>4. Bullet Density</strong>
	<br>
The third part of fighting is controlling bullet densities. Bullet density basically means how many bullets you can pack 
into a small area, and it only matters when you have already fired several shots.
Now, the density control of battleship can be used in a variety of ways, First off, high enough drone density will increase the 
effect of the drones on hitting the enemy. In order to maximize drone density, you want to be moving towards the target, with your 
stack directly in front of you. Then, you release all your drones at once by turning off autofire for a moment, and the resulting 
cloud that is fired at the enemy will be thick enough to almost instantly kill a glass cannon. You can also fight certain powerful 
enemies by tricking them into thinking your power is low by retreating in order to reduce your density, which will often cause 
overconfident enemies to approach because they think they can handle your drones. Then when you drop a much more powerful high 
density second attack on them, some enemies will completely ignore the drone density and walk right into the hit, which can cause 
immediate death. Another important aspect of this is fighting rammers. When on the retreat, bullet density from fire will be quite 
low, not even remotely enough to keep away a fast rammer. However, you can also keep a very close range stack in order to suddenly 
increase your bullet density for a short moment when you drop the stack on the enemy. In order to effectively do this, when the 
rammer gets very close, put your drone stack slightly to one side of them, then juke in the direction of your drones at the same 
moment you release them. This will stall the rammer just long enough to form another stack in order to hold them off again.
	<br>
	<br>
<strong>5. Counters</strong>
	<br>
Now for some important strategic notes. First off, dragon triangles are essentially a hard counter to battleships. 
If you get killed by a high health-high bullet damage triangle, don't feel bad, its the most unavoidable death for battleships. 
Secondly, well built octotanks are also extremely hard to counter, but you can try to stall them with sudden pushes 
(drone density boosts) till something hopefully interrupts them. Next, try to keep track of the boss at all times on your map, 
since you can't block them very well, so its unsafe to be near them for any reason other than hopefully distracting a powerful enemy. 
If there is a recoil rammer on your map (booster or annihilator) do not move straight up and down in the middle of nowhere, since 
even your maximum density drones will be unlikely to save you if they come straight from above/below.
