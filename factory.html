Factory is VERY hard. It is so versatile, but hard to control. You have to be a master to master the master.  Are you READY??
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Controls</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLcjGTw9ap0">Attract Demonstration Video</a>
	<br>
When attracting, if the minions are outside of the spin area, they will go towards the cursor's direction until they enter the spin area.
<br>
When attracting, if the minions are inside of the spin area, they will repel until them enter the spin area. 
In this situation, the "attract" works like repel. This allows the minions to move at faster speed with the help 
from the minion's bullet recoil.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhs-EKNY6Fc">Repel and Leash Demonstration Video</a>
	<br>
When repelling, if the minions are outside of the spin area, they will do the general repel (just like other drone tanks).
<br>
When repelling Inside a specific area (I call it "The Leash") (about 1 ~ 4 grid box), the minions will be pulled toward 
the cursor and, will perform just like normal attract of other drone tanks. 
If the mouse is moved too fast, the minions will be unable to follow the leash. 
This allows the minions to move at faster speed with the help from the minion's bullet recoil.
	<br>
	<br>
When repelling in the spin area and outside the leash, the minions will spin clock wise and 
shoot outwards until they escape the spin area. It will move like normal drone tank's repel.
	<br>
	<br>	
Spinning attract: Use attract to spin around the "Spin area" (In this case, because of the special drone movement Factory has, 
the attract is actually repel), shrink the circle in the process, then Repel in the center of 6 minions. 
This usually takes less than 3 seconds. 
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogn9yrmqL0w">Shooting Star Demonstration Video</a>
	<br>
Shooting Star: use the spinning attract to attract all 6 minions (become a star shape), then charge 
towards the opponent with the minions as shield in front of the Master. When moving toward a direct along with minions 
leashed, if you have the same movement speed as bullet speed (For example, 7 bullet speed and 7 movement speed), 
you don't need to move the mouse because they have the same movement speed as you do.

	<strong>2. What to do and what to avoid</strong>
	<br>
And all that, is just the tip of the iceberg of the mess of skills, tactics, builds, practice, 
and everything else that comes with being a factory main.
But the real fun hasn't started yet. Anokuu has most certainly covered the controls, but I am going to cover how 
to actually use those controls.
	<br>
	<br>
	So what factory gains in power it makes up for in an utter lack of ability to use that power effectively without a lot of experience and work in the class.
So in order to use factory effectively, you need to do three things: Learn how to control the drones, learn 
how to use low damage drones effectively, and be able to hit enemies from close range.
	<br>
	<br>
So the important part here is to take advantage of all of factory's power to cover as many of its weaknesses as you can.
The first weakness to be covered is controlling the drones, which is getting back to what I said at the beginning. 
Now looking at Anokuu's huge block of text on controlling drones, it might seem like a daunting task at first. 
But here is the first and most important thing I am going to tell you about that: You can get massive factory 
scores without ever using the right click button.
	<br>
	<br>
I know this because having played factory a large amount and having also watched many youtube 
videos of factory players breaking 500k or more, I have learned that the only time when repelling is 
generally used is to get drones around enemy drone classes and very occasionally finish off a retreating enemy, 
although even then it is uncommon. The other common feature of the right-click, the attracting/shooting star technique, 
is overshadowed by the much simpler technique of point-and click while moving.
	<br>
	<br>
So for me and every other major factory player, the number one technique is simply that: 
point and click while moving. The reason being that when the target for the drones is far away and 
you move to constantly put that target further away, the drones will naturally converge onto a single path, 
creating a group of drones all firing in the same direction.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://streamable.com/q4z3u">Point and Click Technique</a>
	<br>
Using just this type of motion, it is possible to achieve a lot with the factory, in fact most of its viable 
techniques can be achieved with just this technique alone.
It is still a good idea to take to sandbox and mess with the right-click controls since they do occasionally help, 
but those are more extra bonuses you should learn after mastering the moving click in all its forms.
	<br>
	<br>
Here is the other most important part of factory drone control: Aiming past the enemy.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://streamable.com/4afss"><strong>What NOT to do</strong></a>
	<br>
In this section, I placed my mouse directly onto the target spreadshot. 
Because of this , when I got close not only did the drones keep too great a distance for the bullets to have much effect, 
but they also rotated out of the way and left me wide open for getting torn apart by the spreadshot.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://streamable.com/8o013"><strong>What you SHOULD do</strong></a>
	<br>
Notice that in this demonstration I keep my cursor more forward, and when I actually see the target 
I put it way past the target, and because of that the drones did not change directions to give away my body or have weak hits, 
instead finishing off the enemy before even making physical contact.
	<br>
	<br>
While these are obviously simple examples, basically the same concepts apply to most fights in general, 
just with more chasing and more turning. After a bit of practice, you will come to be able to kill basically anything 
in a 1v1 fight, because it doesn't have the power or reaction to stop you.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>3. Final Notes</strong>
	<br>
So after mastering the controls the other two weaknesses, inability to use the drones effectively and necessity to 
get close to a target are still left to be covered. Lucky for us, these two weaknesses actually cancel each other out!
	<br>
	<br>
Here's why: What better way to take advantage of low damage but high health drones than to use them as a shield to get close?
The answer, there isn't! The answer to the second weakness, how to use the drones, is to use them to cover the third weakness, 
needing to get close. Therefore, when fighting most enemies the simplest way to overpower them is to simply walk up guns 
blazing, and use the drones to both get your firepower right in the enemies face where its supposed to be while also protecting 
you from harm by the enemy.
