I think the secret to Mega Trapper is patience. Notice how freaking long it took. I mean, I died by suicide because I had no time 
left, no player was able to stop me. I will, when I have a few hours free, crush the world record once and for all!
(and it will be very, very boring)
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>1. Strategies</strong>
This is all about more strategies, specifically with the 01377717 build.
So the first part was about defensive and retreating kills, this second part is about offense, 
because sometimes you really just need to kill stuff! (lol) Anyways, Mega Trapper is actually not a bad killer 
for a couple of reasons which I have discovered as I continue to play it.
	<br>
	<br>
First off, and this is VERY important, is that Mega Trapper has the viewing range of a sniper, which its huge-shot 
counterpart the destroyer does not. For those people who play destroyer fairly often and effectively, turning to 
Mega Trapper seems like a major disappointment because you can't hit anything on your screen, only things within a close 
range. However, having experience in destroyer doesn't necessarily help with Mega Trapper in any other way than the fact that 
attacks from above/below are more likely to surprise the target.
	<br>
	<br>
When I first started playing Mega Trapper, I was always under the impression that everything that I saw was also able to see me. 
Therefore, I would constantly feel under pressure to make a shot the instant I saw something even though that doesn't work 
offensively. The instincts of destroyer players only work on the retreat when something you see on the edge of you screen up 
or down is actually in range of your shot because of the movement adding to the effective range of your trap.
	<br>
	<br>
When it comes to attacking as Mega Trapper, you have to understand that a good 50-80% of kills per game will be due to the 
environment. For example, one of my favorite techniques for killing is center camping. You sit at the very edge of the standard 
homing range of crashers, so you can see them but they don't attack you. When you see the crashers move, you know that there is 
a target in the center and they might leave the center in your direction at any second. Move in closer to the center, and if 
you see the player come running out of the center, cut off their retreat in one shot. This works surprisingly well against rammers 
with little comets of crashers after them, you can  assume that about 50% of the time the enemy won't turn around, and you can hit 
them head on, which can occasionally be deadly, and often stop their momentum long enough to get a second slight hit in which can 
sometimes finish the job.
	<br>
	<br>
Another interesting way to get kills is to just leave a random trap in the middle of a bunch of shapes. 
Preferably done with red or purple team colors, (also works in FFA/Maze because your enemies see it as red) because those 
are the two natural triangle colors and people will be less suspicious of them. In my most recent gameplay, where I scored 263k, 
3 level 45 kills and 2 weaker player kills came seemingly completely randomly from off-screen due to enemies running into traps 
I left a good 20-30 seconds previously.
	<br>
	<br>
As for direct kills, they are in fact quite possible and even fairly likely with experience. All you have to understand is 
that attacking while the enemy is under stress is the best moment to strike, and you have to get as close as you can. (From experience, 
Spread Shots are nearly immune to this because the number of bullets they have to push your shot away is so great it can usually be 
blocked by just a swing of the guns) Also, when I say under stress I don't just mean in a head on fight, I mean in combat with a 
variety of things. If the player is injured and retreating, they are definitely under stress, even if nothing is shooting at them. 
If a player runs up to the fully stocked center and starts farming the pentagons, they are under stress because they have a limited 
time to grab as many points as they can, where both their health due to crashers and their survival chances due to powerful level 45's 
appearing are decreasing every second.
	<br>
	<br>
The thing about making a close strike is that the closer you get, the more effective the trap you fire will be at 
both blocking defensive shots should they come and making the kill should get a hit. While it is risk to do this attack, 
there are ways of reducing the risk.
	<br>
	<br>
The first way is NOT shooting traps everywhere while moving towards the center. Every trap you shoot is a trail of 
breadcrumbs that people can follow in order to find you, and if you get someone blocking off your escape from the bullet 
spammer you failed to kill, your as good as dead without lucky team support or other pure luck events.
	<br>
	<br>
The second way is to know where the enemy is going and simply playing with Mega Trapper long enough that your aim with 
the trap is maximized. Over time, I have gained the ability to shoot traps into just the right place to get kills, which
I did not as easily do at the beginning of my time with Mega Trapper. If you want to play this class, make sure you get 
used to its aim fairly quickly because hitting an opponent as they boost in ANY direction is the most effective way of 
getting maximum damage in on them, but that won't happen without instinctual knowledge of where the trap will go when you shoot it.
	<br>
	<br>
The final thing for this section is practice. And I don't mean practice of aiming, skill or anything like that. 
If you have time, go into sandbox and just spawn a second tank, give it like 2 max health and 3 body damage, and kill it 
over and over and over again. No difficulty except for backing up as much as you want to see if you can kill from that distance. 
Try killing a moving target, try killing a rammer, try killing everything you can think of. It seems easy and useless, but the 
instinctual knowledge of what will be killed by what shot is so incredibly valuable that it cannot be overstated. You need to 
be able to take advantage of every possible opportunity, and this "practice" will make that much easier.
